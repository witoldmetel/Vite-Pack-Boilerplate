# TS Parcel Boilerplate

This is a minimal boilerplate using React and TypeScript along with Sass support. Itâ€˜s also possible to config firebase and use Tailwind low-level utility classes. Good for small projects and prototyping. Enjoy to use :)

Deploy page on GH-Pages

```
yarn deploy

if you receive this error message:

```

You need to install gh-pages globally by adding "-g":

```
npm install -g gh-pages --save-dev
```
